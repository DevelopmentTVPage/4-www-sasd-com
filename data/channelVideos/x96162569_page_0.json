Best Mind and Brain Tricks.\nIQ Test \/ Intelligence Quotient Test - Trick questions.\n\nANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS:\n\nA1:  TRUE\nExplanation: Because the first two statements are true, raspberries are the most expensive of the three.\n\nA2:  TRUE\nExplanation: There are fewer oranges than either apples or lemons, so the statement is true. \nEasy method: (Try this method to solve without any confusion) \n1. A fruit basket contains more apples than lemons = APP greater than LEM \n2. There are more lemons in the basket than there are oranges = LEM greater than ORG \nNow, Combine the above two results: APP greater than LEM greater than ORG \n3. The basket contains more apples than oranges (APP greater than ... ORG) = Yes.\nTherefore, the given 3rd statement is true.\n\nA3:  TRUE\nExplanation: We know that there are Signots with buttons, or Lamels, and that there are yellow Signots, which have no buttons. Therefore, Lamels do not have buttons and cannot be yellow.\n\nA4:  2\nExplanation: Statement 2 is the only true statement. Since all dogs like to run, then the ones who like to swim also like to run. There is no support for statement 1 or statement 3.\n\n\nAUDIO: Fly High - Gunnar Olsen (Dance & Electronic  Funky)",
